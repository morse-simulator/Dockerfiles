An image to build the documentation of Morse

The default job waits for two external volumes:
  - (optionally) /src where /src/morse contains a git clone of Morse. If it is
	not present, the script will do a complete clone, which can be quite slow.
  - /out, /out/html will contain the documentation of Morse
